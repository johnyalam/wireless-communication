_Learning outcomes:_ This course introduces the fundamental theories used in communication engineering. The students will be able to design/analyze simple wireless communication systems, including physical layer for analog and digital transmission (e.g. bandwidth, channel modeling, modulation, demodulation, bit-error rate, channel capacity, etc.).
